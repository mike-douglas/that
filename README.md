That, as a Service.

It's "that" from If This, Then That. Read more about it [here](http://directive.io/articles/that-as-a-service/)

## Overview

`that` is a very small Node HTTP proxy providing simple key-based authentication and JSONP support in front of a [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) database.

The HTTP methods for PUT/POST require the key, but simple GETs do not.

## Development

```
$ docker-compose up
```
